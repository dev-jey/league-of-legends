                into half, write from 1 to 3, from top to bottom on the left, and from top to bottom on the right from 4
                to 6.Go clockwise and then engage in battle with first a team and symmetry and symmetry between a team
                of Battle, repeat it back into the first order. This is the first round and there are two rounds. After
                two rounds, they rank teams to drop half of the teams. After second round, it goes to postseason to
                determine the final winning team.
