            <h2>Introducing the three favored teams to win
            </h2>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            It has already been eight years since this competition was held in Korea. So far, the level of all teams has
            risen to such an extent that it is difficult to predict the outcome of the match except for the lower-ranked
            teams.
            But as a fan of this competition, I choose three favored teams to win are T1, DRX and DWG.

            <h2>T1</h2>
            <p>
                First, the reason why I chose T1 as a favored team to win is because T1 is a veteran team that always
                goes up after the mid period of the competition. T1 has been consistently at the top since 2013, the
                year after the first competition was held in Korea. T1 has won LCK as many as nine times. Therefore I
                chose T1 as one of the favorites, though it is fourth place now. T1 is a team that leads the game very
                stably. The team prefers characters that weak early and strong later in the game. This tendency can be
                seen as the exact opposite of the other two teams.

            <h2>DRX</h2>
            <p>
                Second, DRX is a very strong candidate for the championship, currently topping the list. DRX has always
                been a lower-ranked team, but with coach Lee Dae-ho's outstanding coaching skills and ability to nurture
                players last season, the team has risen directly from the bottom to the top. DRX tend to play very
                aggressively in the first half of the game with faster reaction speed and judgment as DWG.

        <br>
        <section class="main-section">
            <h2>DWG</h2>
            <p>
                Third, DWG is a team where all the players on the team can be playmakers. Not one outstanding player
                leads the team, but it is such a balanced team where all the team members show good performance. Like
                DRX, it is a team that prefers aggressive play.
