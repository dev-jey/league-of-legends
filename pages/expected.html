            <p>
                To predict the outcome of this competition, I think the first place will be DRX and the second place
                will be T1 and the third place will be DWG.

            <h2>DWG</h2>
            <p>
                All the team members have excellent skills, but on the contrary, there is no super-excellent player.
                Because of the nature of this game, I think it's better to have one playmaker to lead the game to
                victory. It is also the team's strength to play aggressively, with the flow very fast from the
                beginning of the game, but it also falls behind DRX.
            </p>

            <h2>T1</h2>
            <p>
                T1 is a symbolic team of LCKs. The team has always been at the top, winning three world
                championships and winning nine lck championships. However, Lee Sang-hyuk, the captain of the team
                that has been leading the team since 2013, has recently shown poor performance. Although he has held
                the top position for seven years, his performance is not very good recently. However, I think this
                team will be the runner-up, as it has always shown great potential in the second half of the
                tournament.
            </p>

            <h2>DRX</h2>
            <p>
                DRX's tremendous performance in just two seasons after recruiting Lee Dae-ho is just amazing. He
                instantly made his team at the bottom of the list top. All the other top-tier team members have been
                proven players for years, but it's amazing that DRX won third place with three rookies. Although the
                tournament is now in the middle, the team is undefeated except for one loss to the mid-tier team.
